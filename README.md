# Cancer-Prediction
Cancer Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cancer in patients using machine learning techniques in Python.
The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of a prediction model, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data patterns and relationships using graphs and charts.

Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

Evaluation: Measuring the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and other metrics.

The aim of this project is to showcase how data analysis and machine learning can be used for early cancer detection, helping in timely medical intervention.
